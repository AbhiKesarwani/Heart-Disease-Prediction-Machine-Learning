# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical and lifestyle parameters. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model was trained and evaluated to provide insights into predictive performance.

# Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality globally. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare by predicting heart disease risk. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle  

Attributes: The dataset includes medical metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors like smoking habits.  

Technologies Used
The project is built using the following tools and libraries:

# Python 3.10+
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis  

NumPy: Numerical computations  

Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and metrics  

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization  


# Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1- Clone the repository:  

git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name/heart-disease-prediction.git  

cd heart-disease-prediction  

2- Create a virtual environment:  

python -m venv venv  

source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  

3- Install dependencies:  

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

1- Dataset Preparation: Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.  

2- Run the Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook:  


jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb  


Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

# Results
Model Used: Logistic Regression (or replace with the model you used)  

Accuracy: 85% (example metric; replace with actual results)  

Precision: 82%  

Recall: 84%  

The confusion matrix and other visualizations are available in the notebook for better insight.
